# Installation and Usage Instructions

This guide will help you set up and run the software.

## Installation

1. **Wallet Addresses Setup:**
    - Fill in the file `./data/addresses.txt` with your wallet addresses, each on a new line.

2. **Proxy Setup (Optional):**
    - If desired, you can set up a different proxy for each account by filling in the `./data/proxies.txt` file.
    - Proxy format: `http://login:password@ip:port` or `socks://login:password@ip:port`.
    - It is important that the number of addresses and proxies match. However, this step is optional and the `proxies.txt` file can be left empty.

3. **Installing Dependencies:**
    - Run the command `npm i` to install the required dependencies. This should be done once at the beginning.
